To do:
-If others contribute, then put author lines in the pkg files (and maybe the ados)
-figure out what to do with the ados that have no pkg files (should really be here?)
-Figure out unit tests. See gen_test_sript.sh. Should I have a general one at test.do? have separate do files per package? or embedded commands in pkg file? See if anyone online has done unit tests
-Get rid of grepr '${dir' .
-Should I turn on -mata set matastrict- for the mlib compilation?
